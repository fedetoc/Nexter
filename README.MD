# Nexter

This is a desktop-first HTML/SASS-CSS only proyect developed as a front-end sample of a website for a fictional real state company.

It was made to put my skills into practice while I was taking the "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This project has been deployed! Feel free to visit [Nexter](https://fedetoc.github.io/nexter/)!
